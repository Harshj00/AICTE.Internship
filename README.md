🌍 Greenhouse Gas Emission Prediction Model
This project focuses on predicting greenhouse gas emissions using historical environmental and industrial data. Developed during my internship, the goal was to build a machine learning pipeline that helps in forecasting future emissions, aiding in climate change analysis and sustainability planning.

📌 Project Overview
🔮 Objective: Predict future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on historical data.

🧠 Approach: Implement machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and others to identify trends and patterns in GHG data.

📊 Outcome: Provide an interpretable and accurate model for forecasting emissions, with visualizations for insights.

📈 Workflow
Data Collection – Obtained datasets from publicly available climate sources.

Preprocessing – Cleaned and prepared data for modeling (handled missing values, encoding, scaling).

EDA – Analyzed trends and correlations between features and emissions.

Model Training – Trained various regression models to predict emissions.

Evaluation – Compared models using MAE, RMSE, and R² score.

Visualization – Plotted actual vs predicted emissions for interpretability.

🔍 Key Features
Multiple regression models for performance comparison.

Reproducible pipeline from preprocessing to prediction.

Visual analytics for emission trends and forecasts.

📊 Sample Results
Random Forest Regressor achieved an R² score of 0.91 on test data, showing strong predictive performance.

🚀 Future Improvements
Add deep learning models (e.g., LSTM for time-series forecasting).

Incorporate real-time emission data sources.

Build an interactive dashboard with Streamlit or Flask.
